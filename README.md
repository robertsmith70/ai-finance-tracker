ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
AI Finance Tracker (Backend)
This project began as a basic Express and MongoDB application to track financial expenses. Over time, it has evolved through several key architectural and security improvements to reflect real-world development practices.

ðŸš€ Key Iterations & Progress
Initial Setup:

Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB using Mongoose for schema modeling.

Implemented basic CRUD operations for expense tracking.

Modular Architecture:

Refactored code into a clean MVC structure:
controllers/, models/, routes/, and middleware/.

Introduced centralized error handling and route organization.

User Authentication:

Integrated secure JWT-based authentication.

Added registration and login functionality.

Passwords are hashed with bcrypt; tokens are stored in secure HTTP-only cookies.

Protected Routes & Ownership:

Users can only access their own expense data.

Middleware verifies tokens and ensures route protection.

Data Validation & Security Practices:

Backend includes input validation and field checking.

Structured to support future additions like helmet, rate limiting, and data sanitization.

âœ… Features Implemented
User registration & login with hashed passwords

Authenticated routes using JWT & cookies

Expense CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Per-user data protection & ownership

Modular codebase with scalable folder structure
